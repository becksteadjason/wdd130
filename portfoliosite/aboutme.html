                    Hello! My name is Jason Beckstead, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.
            
                    I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Utah, where I spent my formative years exploring its stunning landscapes and vibrant culture. At the age of eighteen, I embarked on a transformative journey to 
                    London, England, where I dedicated two years to volunteer work. This experience broadened my horizons and instilled in me a deep appreciation for global perspectives and community service.
            
                    Upon returning to Utah, I found my calling in the field of education as a paraprofessional, later transitioning into applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT). Working 
                    closely with individuals with diverse needs, I discovered the profound impact of compassionate support and evidence-based interventions.
            
                    As my passion for understanding human behavior and cognition grew, I decided to pursue higher education. I initially enrolled in an online program at BYU-Idaho with a focus on psychology. However, my journey 
                    took an unexpected turn when I realized my fascination with technology and problem-solving led me to embrace computer science.
            
                    Outside of academics and work, you can often find me indulging in my hobbies. I have a deep love for art and enjoy expressing myself through drawing. Fitness is also a significant part of my life, and I regularly 
                    hit the gym to stay active and energized. When I'm not immersed in my studies or pursuing my passions, I unwind by diving into the world of video games. Above all, I cherish moments spent with my loved ones, whether 
                    it's sharing laughs, exploring new places, or simply enjoying each other's company.
            
                    I am continually seeking opportunities for growth and learning, whether it's through formal education, hands-on experiences, or the wealth of knowledge available online. I am excited about the journey ahead and the 
                    chance to make meaningful contributions in both my professional and personal pursuits.
            
                    Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I look forward to connecting with you further!
