      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page serves as an introduction, providing visitors with a glimpse of my portfolio, a concise overview of myself, and a 
        list of my skills. Through the navigation bar, visitors can easily access additional options, ideas, and information. Its main 
        purpose is to offer a brief overview of my work, with key content accessible via the navigation bar options: "My Work," "About Me," 
        and "Contact." As I complete more advanced projects over time, the "My Work" section will highlight my top accomplishments, showcasing 
        my greatest achievements in this introductory space.

        The text under the "My Work" will be a title of one of my projects, a short description of my project, and the technologies used to create the project (HTML, CSS, Python, etc.). 
        The project I will be putting there is title: "Aqua Adrenaline," a short description "During my initial Web Fundamentals (WDD130) course at BYU Idaho University, we were tasked with 
        constructing a prototype website as a practical application of our learning in HTML and CSS," and the technologies used "HTML and CSS."

        In contrast to the "My Work" section featured on the home page, this page will exhibit a comprehensive collection of past, ongoing, and upcoming projects that I wish to highlight. Each project will 
        adhere to the same format as seen in the "My Work" section on the home page, featuring a project title, a brief description, and the technologies utilized in its development (such as HTML, CSS, Python, etc.). 
        Due to the limited number of projects available, the wireframe will present only a select few. Currently, the sole project showcased will be Aqua Adrenaline, until additional projects are completed and integrated.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        Text for About Me: "Hello! My name is Jason Beckstead, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.

        I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Utah, where I spent my formative years exploring its stunning landscapes and vibrant culture. At the age of eighteen, I embarked on a transformative journey to 
        London, England, where I dedicated two years to volunteer work. This experience broadened my horizons and instilled in me a deep appreciation for global perspectives and community service.

        Upon returning to Utah, I found my calling in the field of education as a paraprofessional, later transitioning into applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT). Working 
        closely with individuals with diverse needs, I discovered the profound impact of compassionate support and evidence-based interventions.

        As my passion for understanding human behavior and cognition grew, I decided to pursue higher education. I initially enrolled in an online program at BYU-Idaho with a focus on psychology. However, my journey 
        took an unexpected turn when I realized my fascination with technology and problem-solving led me to embrace computer science.

        Outside of academics and work, you can often find me indulging in my hobbies. I have a deep love for art and enjoy expressing myself through drawing. Fitness is also a significant part of my life, and I regularly 
        hit the gym to stay active and energized. When I'm not immersed in my studies or pursuing my passions, I unwind by diving into the world of video games. Above all, I cherish moments spent with my loved ones, whether 
        it's sharing laughs, exploring new places, or simply enjoying each other's company.

        I am continually seeking opportunities for growth and learning, whether it's through formal education, hands-on experiences, or the wealth of knowledge available online. I am excited about the journey ahead and the 
        chance to make meaningful contributions in both my professional and personal pursuits.

        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I look forward to connecting with you further!"
