        Description: "In my Web Fundamentals (WDD130) course at BYU-Idaho, I gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS by creating a prototype website. 
        This project involved translating a wireframe into a functional website, allowing me to apply the theoretical knowledge I had learned in class to 
        a practical scenario. Building the website from scratch challenged me to understand the interplay between HTML structure and CSS styling, solidifying 
        my grasp of these fundamental web development concepts."

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        Text for About Me: "Hello! My name is Jason Beckstead, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.

        I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Utah, where I spent my formative years exploring its stunning landscapes and vibrant culture. At the age of eighteen, I embarked on a transformative journey to 
        London, England, where I dedicated two years to volunteer work. This experience broadened my horizons and instilled in me a deep appreciation for global perspectives and community service.

        Upon returning to Utah, I found my calling in the field of education as a paraprofessional, later transitioning into applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT). Working 
        closely with individuals with diverse needs, I discovered the profound impact of compassionate support and evidence-based interventions.

        As my passion for understanding human behavior and cognition grew, I decided to pursue higher education. I initially enrolled in an online program at BYU-Idaho with a focus on psychology. However, my journey 
        took an unexpected turn when I realized my fascination with technology and problem-solving led me to embrace computer science.

        Outside of academics and work, you can often find me indulging in my hobbies. I have a deep love for art and enjoy expressing myself through drawing. Fitness is also a significant part of my life, and I regularly 
        hit the gym to stay active and energized. When I'm not immersed in my studies or pursuing my passions, I unwind by diving into the world of video games. Above all, I cherish moments spent with my loved ones, whether 
        it's sharing laughs, exploring new places, or simply enjoying each other's company.

        I am continually seeking opportunities for growth and learning, whether it's through formal education, hands-on experiences, or the wealth of knowledge available online. I am excited about the journey ahead and the 
        chance to make meaningful contributions in both my professional and personal pursuits.

        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I look forward to connecting with you further!"
